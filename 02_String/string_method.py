# start practice for sting method


# 01 uppercase method
# a = "this is example of upper case"
# b = "this is second example "
# c = "abcde"
# d = "mncbi"
# print(a.upper())
# print(b.upper())
# print(c.upper())
# print(d.upper())

# 02 lower case method
# e = "ABCDEF"
# F = "ARPIT"
# G = "EXCEL"
# print(e.lower())
# print(F.lower())
# print(G.lower())

# 03 rstrip method
# h = "just do it !@#$!"
# i = "iamadequate %^&"
# j = "work hard +-&*"
# print(h.rstrip("!@#$!"))
# print(i.rstrip("%^&"))
# print(j.rstrip("+-&*"))

# 04 replace method 
# k = "you can"
# l = "only one is sufficient"
# m = "you can understand "
# print(k.replace("can","can't"))
# print(l.replace("one","two"))
# print(m.replace("understand","do it"))

# 05 spillting method
# n = "one two three foue five six"
# o = "arpit ram ganesh vishnu abhimanu"
# p = "monday tuesday thusday wednesday friday "
# print(n.split(" "))
# print(o.split(" "))
# print(p.split(" "))
 
# 06 capatilize method
# q = "education is must for everyone"
# r = "i am not ai"
# s = "human being"
# print(q.capitalize())
# print(r.capitalize())
# print(s.capitalize())

# 07 string center method
# t = " have a nice day. "
# u = " i do my best ."
# print(t.center(30))
# print(u.center(30))

# 08 count method 
# v = " abcdef abcdef abcdef"
# w = " this is the method of sting method"
# x = " monday kab hai monday kal hai"
# print(v.count("abcdef"))
# print(w.count("method"))
# print(x.count("hai"))

# 09 endswith metod
# y = " i like play chess."
# z = "i like play football"
# print(y.endswith("."))
# print(z.endswith("."))

# 10 starwith method 
# aa = "chess is my favourate game."
# bb = "football is my favourate game."
# print(aa.startswith("chess"))
# print(bb.startswith("football"))
