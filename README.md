Test Question for Basic

**1. String Methods**
      a) String Methods and Operations:
            What does the upper() method do to a string? Write a Python code snippet to convert the string "hello" to uppercase.
            How does the replace() method work in strings? Write a program that replaces the word "apple" with "orange" in the string "I like apple pie".
            Write a Python code to find the length of the string "DataScience" using a string method.
      
      b) String Slicing:
            Given the string str = "Programming", what will be the result of str[3:8]?
            What does str[-3:] return when the string is "Hello, World!"? Explain negative indexing.

**2. Taking User Input & Type Casting**
      a) Taking Input from the User:
            Write a Python program that takes a user’s first name and last name as input and prints their full name.
            How would you take a user's age as input and print the user’s age after 5 years?

      b) Type Casting:
            You have two variables: x = "25" (string) and y = 5 (integer). Write a program to add x and y after converting x to an integer.
            Write a program that asks the user for a number (as a string) and converts it to an integer. Then print the result of multiplying the number by 10.

**3. Simple Calculator Using User Input**
      a) Calculator Program:
            Write a simple Python program to take two numbers as input from the user and print their sum, difference, product, and quotient. Ensure the program handles division by zero               gracefully.

      b) Type Casting in Calculator:
            Modify the calculator program to take the inputs as strings, convert them to integers, and then perform the operations.

**4. Handling Negative and Positive Indices**
      a) Negative and Positive Indexing in Strings:
            Consider the string message = "Python is fun!". What will the following expressions output?
                    message[7]
                    message[-4]
                    message[2:6]
                    message[-3:]

      b) String Indexing:
            Given the string "Learn Python", write a Python program to:
                    Extract the substring "Python" using slicing.
                    Extract the last character of the string using negative indexing.

**5. Combining String and Numerical Operations**
      a) String and Integer Operations:
            Write a program that asks the user to input a number and then multiplies it by a constant string "5" (after converting the string to an integer). For example, if the user                 enters 10, the output should be 50.
            How would you take the user’s input as a number (say, x = 6) and append it to a string like "The result is: "?

**6. String Manipulation with User Input**
      a) User Input and String Manipulation:
            Write a program where the user is asked to enter their favorite hobby. The program should then print a message with the hobby in uppercase, reversed, and then the length of               the hobby string.
